# Meme-Tinder

Tinder but for memes

A proof of concept that workshop teams fork and extend. It is an npm workspaces monorepo:

- `backend/`: Express + TypeScript API on port 3000. Serves the seed memes (original SVGs in `backend/assets/memes`).
- `frontend/`: React + Vite + TypeScript on port 5173. The dev server proxies `/api` to the backend.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer (see `.nvmrc`; run `nvm use` if you use nvm)
- npm 10 or newer

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173, then swipe memes with the Like and Nope buttons. When all memes are swiped, press Reset to start over.

## Commands

| Command         | What it does                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts backend and frontend in watch mode     |
| `npm test`      | Runs all backend and frontend tests           |
| `npm run build` | Builds both workspaces                        |

## API

All endpoints are under `/api` and need an `X-User-Id` header (the frontend creates an anonymous id on first visit and stores it in localStorage).

| Endpoint                | Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /api/memes/next`   | `200 { "meme": {...} }` with the next unseen meme, or `200 { "meme": null }` when all memes have been swiped |
| `POST /api/swipes`      | Body `{ "memeId": "...", "direction": "like" \| "nope" }`. `200` with the stored swipe                       |
| `DELETE /api/swipes`    | Removes all of the user's swipes, including likes. `204 No Content`; safe to call repeatedly                 |

Errors are JSON `{ "error": "..." }`: `400` for a missing user id, missing meme id or invalid direction, `404` for an unknown meme id. Swiping the same meme twice is idempotent: the first swipe is kept.

Swipes are stored in memory (`backend/src/swipes/repository.ts`) and are lost on restart. Implement `SwipeRepository` to plug in a database.
